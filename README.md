# Ts-logger

English | [Русский](./README.ru.md) 

This is a simple logger. Now there are a lot of different loggers, but they are all lackluster. From time to time I do web scraping. One way or another, I spend quite a lot of time in the console, and I would like to properly see the data that I collect. The second reason is that all the loggers that I saw were not configured the way I wanted. They either displayed the time or did not display it. Few loggers have grouping; you collect data from the page, display it, and the collected information from the page is merged, which is not convenient. I would like to somehow distinguish them. This library is designed to work in a terminal and cannot be used in a browser.
